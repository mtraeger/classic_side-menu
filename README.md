Old Menu
===========

Forked by Michael TrÃ¤ger. This is without the tiny Icons and with a fix max-width of 100px for the Menu.

Forked from https://github.com/SansPseudoFix/Old_menu

Menu on the left side for [owncloud](http://owncloud.org/).

When screen width is larger than 1100px, menu is placed to the left (like old oc menu). Smaller than 1100px, menu bring back
to the top.
